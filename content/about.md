# About the site
Coffee Pudding, or pudding.coffee, is a blog spearheaded by [Pudding](/authors/pudding). The idea is to create write-ups, tutorials, or literally just opinions on technical stuff. But that can change.

Feel free to browse at your leisure. Pudding will try to maintain a chill environment. Posts should be as fun as possible. The UI is also as intuitive as it can be, thanks to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and its custom theme [Eureka](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-eureka/).

Next section is automatically generated by Hugo. It looks good so leaving it as it is.
