# Life won't pause and wait for you

Let me start with a popular quote.

I know, these times are hard. Many of us are merely trying to survive.

And that is fine. I want to give you a pat on the back for a job well done. I will not force you to change whatever your state is right now.

But still, reality sucks. Life is not an episode of your favorite series on Netflix that you can pause whenever you hear the call of nature.

Yes, we have our own timelines. However, this is not an excuse to do nothing.

# You'd be surprised what boredom can do

Or maybe you don't need these positivity shenanigans and you're already craving for something to do. After all, the software development industry is [relatively one of the less impacted by the worldwide quarantine](https://jaxenter.com/github-developer-covid-report-171816.html). We remain productive as things outside get wild, thanks to the continuous growth of internet-based solutions.

Either way, what can we do?

The most obvious thing is to **start a project.** We're developers after all. I don't care what it is this project. I'm sure with years of college/university and perhaps experience, you have an idea or two. Just start one.

You don't need to be in the mood. Gather the tools. Research. You may still be in a dilemma right now, but many times it's just that our brain is wired to crave comfort. Start. Start making something possible.

Still doubting? Let me toss you some ideas you can start with:
- **Blog**. Static-site generators make things easy for you to create one. There's a lot of tools and themes in different languages to choose from. Many of them are free and open-sourced. Nothing to host it on? Start with a free hosting solution via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- **Create an online resume**. This can also be done via static-site generators. I tell employers on my cover e-mail something along the lines of:
    
        My actual resume is attached. You may also see it online at xxxx.xxx.xxx
    
    And it looks nice. This is where you show off your portfolio and other things people can't see on your actual resume.

- A **CRUD app** using your favored language. Or even in another language where you printed *Hello World* years back and never used again. I suggest design with REST web services in mind. Or GraphQL.

Ideas aren't limited to the ones I told you about. Just keep yourself busy with something preferably (not necessarily) productive.

# Feed your brain

**Learn a new skill.** Another obvious thing, I know. But let's keep in mind that the industry we are in is changing rapidly. You never know, what you know today may not be relevant tomorrow. Or the next month.

Luckily for us, there's a vast wealth of knowledge on the web. Watch along a course on YouTube. Read books and tutorials. 

Or, follow this blog :wink:

You can also enroll in online course providers ([Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), [SkillShare](https://www.skillshare.com), [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com), etc.). Either get a new skill or update what you have. Peut-être apprendre le Français? I googled that....

Stuck with ASP.NET Framework/MVC? Checkout a .NET Core course. Java 1.5 has long been outdated. Data Science continues to grow. JQuery is nice and all, but single pages and material design with Angular/React/Vue.js are now the thing.

Also, remember to practice what you learn. You can't tell your employer (or future employer) that you *know* one technology. Not only that, practicing lets you commit mistakes. Go get your hands dirty. And this goes back to the previous section.

# Process some papers

No, I don't mean to get married or get out of the country. **Certify**. Many of us don't know the value of one sheet. 

This sheet, or these sheets prove that you have been filtered by governing bodies. These papers raise your value by one notch (or higher). It spices up your resume, and hungry hunters flock under you. 

After all, it's not easy to prove something to someone they can't see. You won't be creating a network infrastructure during an interview, but showing them your CCNP Certification tells them that you can.

Sure, this costs money. But it's worth the investment. And in case you have, make use of your employee benefits. You may have one you don't know of. Ask your manager.

# Fly high, sky high

Many don't know this (including I back then), but many cloud providers such as Azure, AWS, and Heroku provide free hours/months/credits for new accounts. 

**Sign-up and get hands-on with cloud services!** These skills aren't just wonderful to have today, but also this is where you can host the projects you thought of from the previous sections.

# Accept everything; Expect nothing

Let me tell you a story someone told me online.

    One day Kaye encouraged Jake, her friend, to start up his own business. Jake happily obliged.

    A few years later, they meet again. However, Jake isn't the same. Jake messed up. He was left in debt-- divorced, and paying for child support.

    Kaye didn't encourage Jake again.

I don't want you to be discouraged by these stories but still, this is reality. While many people are blessed to have the lenience to take risks, not everyone is.

As developers, we are lucky to be one of the privileged individuals to take risks. Go get up and start something. Then learn from your mistakes. Use these broken pieces of your work to start something new again. 

Don't get stuck in comfort. That's boring. Embrace the uncertainties now and all coming your way.

And yes in case you read [this book by Gary John Bishop](https://sipreads.com/unfuck-yourself), I learned it from there. It was helpful to me personally.
