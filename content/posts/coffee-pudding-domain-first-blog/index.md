# First of history

Hey there! Glad you reached this site’s first-ever blog post. Feel free to browse all the posts to date.

Now that the formalities are out of the way… Pudding Coffee, or Coffee Pudding?

As you probably noticed above, I went for the latter (yes I'm talking about the site's name). It really isn’t the question of which is tastier; or what anyone prefers. It’s more of what sounds more pleasant to one’s ears. Coffee, after all, is more known as a flavor and more fitting as an adjective.

And yes, this is an important question. The site will, after all, bring this name for a long time, if not forever. It’ll be its branding, if one may say.

With all that, how is this name relevant to the site?

…now that’s a tough question– I’d say I just went with the domain.

# The Domain?

It was [last October 24 when went window-shopping for domains](https://twitter.com/kohi_pudding/status/1319694005257433088). After some time grueling that my favored domain costs too much, I found pudding.coffee. I thought this is good and cheap. And there, I decided to purchase the domain.

I’d say it’s an impulse buy. I mean, during that time, I still have no idea what to do with the domain. It was only thanks to an ad somewhere (probably YouTube) that made me checking out domains at GoDaddy. 

So after weekends of research, day-dreamings, I decided what I’m going to do with it. And this blog is born.

It’s a nice feeling and experience getting this up. Back then, I have next to zero ideas on domains, static site generation, and all that. It’s fun trying to play around with these techs that are new to me.

# Motivation

Learning how to generate static sites was just a surplus to what else motivated me to create a blog. I have this daemon thread in me running for years, telling me to write one. I’ve always been fascinated with people creating guides, telling stories, or simply, just having fun writing and letting people enjoy their works.

I also have this in me that wants to stay busy, with the pandemic still in the wild. Yes, this is a product of boredom. Also, as the homepage slogan says, I want to create a project that people will enjoy. After all, I have all the time I have right now on my hands.

# Final Note
I hope one day I will be reading this in nostalgia. Maybe I’ll laugh, be in tears, or even cringe. Or maybe even forget this exists. I don’t know, but I hope I will find this a fine experience.
